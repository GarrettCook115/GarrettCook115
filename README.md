## Hi there, I'm Garrett! ðŸ‘‹

- Recently separated USAF Veteran, diving into the field of IT and CyberSecurity.
- With a few projects and certifications under my belt, I'm just enjoying the journey to becoming a SOC Analyst, Penetration Tester, Red/Blue Teaming, or whatever I find an interest in this field personally. Cyber is vast, so let's see where I'll end up :)
